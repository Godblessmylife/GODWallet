## 🚀 Getting Started

### Android Development

> [!NOTE]  
> We recommend using Apple silicon Macs for development (arm64), if you're using Intel Mac, you need to add `x86_64` to `targets` under `cargoNdk` in `build.gradle.kts`.

1. Download and install latest [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)
2. Install JDK 17, preferably using [SDKMAN](https://sdkman.io/)
3. Run `make boostrap` to install all nessesary tools (Rust / NDK).

Optionally, you can generate models and kotlin bindgen by running `make generate`, Gem Android consumes wallet core library as a local module, if you need to update it, ping us or create an issue on [here]().
